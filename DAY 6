Table: employees(primary key : emp_id ,login)
column name	data type 
emp_id 	        int
login 	        datetime
logout 	        datetime
 
Example Output:
emp_id	criterian
100	1
200	2
300	both

SOLUTION:

with employee_hours
(
Select 
emp_id,
date_trunc('week',login) as week_,
date_trunc('date',login) as day_,
TIMESTAMPDIFF(hour,login,logout) as time_
from employees
)

Select emp_id,
CASE WHEN greater_than_10>=2 and greater_than_8>=3 then 'both'
 when greater_than_10>=2 then 1
 when greater_than_10>=2 then 2
else none
end as criterian
from
(
Select 
week_,
emp_id,
COUNT(CASE WHEN time_>8 the day_ end) as greater_than_8,
COUNT(CASE WHEN time_>10 the day_ end) as greater_than_10
from employee_hours
group by week_,emp_id
) as c1
