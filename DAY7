7 - Lift Overloaded (Part 1)

You are given a table of list of lifts , their maximum capacity and people along with their weight who wants to enter into it. 
You need to make sure maximum people enter into the lift without lift getting overloaded.

For each lift find the comma separated list of people who can be accomodated. The comma separated list should have people in the order of their weight in increasing order.

Table: lifts (primary key : id)
column name	datatype
id 	        int
capacity_kg     int

Table: lift_passengers(primary key : passenger_name )
column name	datatype
passenger_name 	varchar(10)
weight_kg 	int
lift_id 	int
 
Expected Output:
id	passenger_list
1	Adarsh,Dheeraj,Rahul
2	Priti,Neha,Vimal,Himanshi

Query added for temp table:
with lift as
(
SELECT 1 AS lift, 50 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 60 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 3, 70 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 4, 80 as weight_capacity
),

passengers as 
(
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'A' as passenger, 10 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'B' as passenger, 30 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'C' as passenger, 10 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'D' as passenger, 10 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'E' as passenger, 10 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'F' as passenger, 20 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'G' as passenger, 10 as weight
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'H' as passenger, 20 as weight
),

SOLUTION:
passengers_per_lift as 
(
Select 
l.lift as lift_id,
p.passenger as passenger_name,
p.weight,
sum(p.weight) over(partition by l.lift order by p.passenger, p.weight asc) as runn_weight,
l.weight_capacity
from lift l left join passengers p on l.lift=p.lift
)

Select lift_id,STRING_AGG(passenger_name,'|') as passenger_name
from passengers_per_lift where runn_weight<=weight_capacity
group by lift_id
