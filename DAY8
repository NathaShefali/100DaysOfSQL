8 - Lift Overloaded (Part 2)

You are given a table of list of lifts , their maximum capacity and people along with their weight and gender who wants to enter into it. 
You need to make sure maximum people enter into the lift without lift getting overloaded but you need to give preference to female passengers first.

For each lift find the comma separated list of people who can be accomodated. 
The comma separated list should have female first and then people in the order of their weight in increasing order.

Table: lifts (primary key : id)
column name	datatype
id 	        int
capacity_kg 	int
 
Table: lift_passengers(primary key : passenger_name )
column name	datatype
passenger_name 	varchar(10)
weight_kg 	int
gender 	        varchar(1)
lift_id 	int
 
Expected Output:
id	passenger_list
1	Riti,Adarsh,Dheeraj
2	Priti,Neha,Himanshi,Vimal

SOLUTION:
A temporary table is created:
with lift as
(
SELECT 1 AS lift, 50 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 2, 60 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 3, 70 as weight_capacity
UNION ALL
SELECT 4, 80 as weight_capacity
),

passengers as 
(
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'A' as passenger, 10 as weight,'F' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'B' as passenger, 10 as weight,'M' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'C' as passenger, 10 as weight,'F' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 1 AS lift, 'D' as passenger, 10 as weight,'F' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'E' as passenger, 10 as weight,'F' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'F' as passenger, 20 as weight,'M' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'G' as passenger, 10 as weight,'F' as gender
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS lift, 'H' as passenger, 20 as weight,'F' as gender
),
passengers_per_lift as 
(
Select 
l.lift as lift_id,
p.passenger as passenger_name,
p.gender as gender,
p.weight,
sum(p.weight) over(partition by l.lift order by p.gender, p.passenger, p.weight asc) as runn_weight,
l.weight_capacity
from lift l left join passengers p on l.lift=p.lift
)

Select lift_id,STRING_AGG(passenger_name,'|') as passenger_name
from passengers_per_lift where runn_weight<=weight_capacity
group by lift_id
